## NextJs App to Fetch some dummy data

- This is my first NextJs Application, and to test it out, I used the simplest API that I know at [https://api.github.com/users] to fetch and display the data in NextJs.

- It is a bit similar to React, only there are no hooks, and you need to export the async function `getStaticProps`.

That's my first commit for the day: Time is 00:07
